# jsExercises

Basic exercises made during the first week of the coding bootcamp at the New York Code and Design Academy. Includes exercises that cover functions, array's, objects and prototypes. 

For example:
Write a function that, given a string, return an object that contains each key as a letter and the number of times it appears in the string as the value.
Examples:
- "start" --> { s: 1, t: 2, a: 1, r: 1 }
- "fuzzlewuzzle" --> { f: 1, u: 2, z: 4, l: 2, e: 2, w: 1 }
